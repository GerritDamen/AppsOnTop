Install AOT
===========

The best way to install is to use the GNOME extensions' website at adress:
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/472/apps-on-top/

If you know what means 'installing from sources' and if you prefer that, you 
can download it from git: "git clone git://github.com/Obsidien/AppsOnTop.git".
When that's done, copy the 'AppsOnTop@obsidien.github.com' directory in your
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions directory, and enable the Apps On Top
extension, for exemple by 'gnome-tweak-tool' (or by editing the dconf key
org.gnome.shell.enabled-extensions if you prefer manual things). Then, restart
your GNOME Shell. Yeah, that's pretty more complicated than the website way.
